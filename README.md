My Github account was created for robotics and I use it to share code with my teammates, but I also use it for my wake tech class which we will be using to learn how to use Github. 
The repository I created was used to help me learn how to create, copy, and edit a repository so that I can use them in the future. 
The steps I took to clone my repository was first pressing the button that says "file", then I clicked "clone a repository", finally I clicked on the repository I made in the web, and I clicked "clone."
